some variations on the 99-bottles program

bottles.clj - a simple macro and a loop-recur
bottle2s.clj - repace macro with function, loop-recur with trampoline
bottle3s.clj - multimethod to handle the 0 case better; intentional overflow
               (what do you expect after too much beer)
               [now updated to format better, spell out numbers, etc.]
               added sample output in bottles3.out [fix name/contents]
	       remove dead code (check for 0 in >1 case; 
	       (handled by recently added =1 method)
	       [improvements from Bay Area Clojure User Group meeting,
	 	simpler dispatch function, lowercase second half of string 
		used to form compound numbers, eliminate unnecessary do's]
bottles4.clj - functional approach using interleave and map
