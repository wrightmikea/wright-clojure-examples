some variations on the 99-bottles program

clojure.clj - a simple macro and a loop-recur
clojure2.clj - repace macro with funcion, loop-recur with trampoline
clojure3.clj - multimethod to handle the 0 case better; intentional overflow

               [now updated to format better, spell out numbers, etc.]
               added sample output in bottles3.out [fix name/contents]
	       remove dead code (check for 0 in >1 case; 
	       (handled by recently added =1 method)
